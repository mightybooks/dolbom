# llms.txt — Care Energy Project

This site hosts the Care Energy project by Mun Surim.

Care Energy is a narrative-based exploration tool that uses symbolic questions to reflect on how care and emotional energy are experienced and change over time.
It is not a medical service, psychological assessment, or self-improvement product.

Key points:
- Uses simple questions to prompt narrative reflection
- Results are symbolic and descriptive, not evaluative
- Designed as a storytelling experiment rather than a test
- Intended to explore emotional concepts through structure, not analysis

This project exists as part of a broader creative practice that combines writing,
interaction design, and minimal web applications.

The site should be understood as a creative narrative experiment,
not as a personality test or wellness product.
